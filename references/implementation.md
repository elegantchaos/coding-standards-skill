# Implementation Guidance

Use this file when deciding how broad a change should be and how code should be structured.

## Precedence

- Follow repository-local `AGENTS.md` first.
- Then follow any local guidance explicitly referenced by that `AGENTS.md`.
- Use relevant skills.
- Use `~/.local/share/agents/COMMON.md` only to fill gaps or resolve ambiguity.
- Never let shared fallback guidance override explicit local repository rules.

## Change Strategy

- Apply focused changes to perform the requested actions.
- Fix root problems, don't layer workarounds.
- You are allowed to adopt a new architecture, but ask first. Explain what problem it solves and why it is necessary.
- You are allowed to modernize code aggressively.
- You are allowed to add complexity to the design, but ask first. Explain what problem it solves and why it is necessary.

## Refactoring

Prefer a series of small refactorings to one large one.

Our preferred policy is to refactor aggressively to avoid code duplication, and to keep the codebase consistent and modern, even if it risks breaking backwards compatibility.

If you introduce a new architecture or idiom, refactor the existing codebase to stay consistent.

Apply a refactoring scope relevant to the task.

For cleanup, review, and modernisation requests, use a wide scope across the whole code base. For new code and bug fixes, use a narrower scope.

### Wide Scope

Look for codebase-wide refactors that:

- Modernise the code.
- Make it cleaner.
- Make it more consistent.
- Make it more compliant with our guidelines.
- Make it more idiomatic for the language or platform.
- Improve overall test coverage.

### Narrow Scope

- Prefer minimal, focused changes that solve the requested problem.
- Add or update tests for new behaviour.
- Suggest wide scope refactors for follow-up.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Assume that backwards compatibility is not required, unless explicitly requested.
- Assume that you can break existing API contracts, unless explicitly prohibited.
- Do not add shims, wrappers, adapters, aliases, or backward-compatibility layers, unless explicitly requested.
- Treat a refactored API, tool, script, or interface as the new source of truth.
- Update known call sites, tests, and documentation as part of the same change.
- If compatibility support is requested, make it explicit and keep its scope tight.

## Interfaces And Dependencies

- Keep interfaces explicit, intentionally small, and unsurprising.
- Avoid hidden coupling and surprising side effects.
- Do not add dependencies without clear justification.
- Keep secrets and credentials out of source control and out of committed configuration.

## Formatting

- Prefer formatters and linters over manual stylistic rewriting.
- Use project configuration or language-specific guidance to determine format/lint tooling.

## Documentation

- Update when workflows, commands, designs, architecture or implementation changes.
- Avoid referring to the past - document the current state or future plans.
- Remove stale or contradictory docs rather than layering new text on top.
- Keep factual, concise, and aligned with current behavior.
- Retain roadmap and planning documentation if it is still relevant; remove if implemented.
- If specifically instructed to produce a migration guide, you can provide historical context, otherwise avoid it.

## Comments

- Update whenever code is touched.
- Do not use to restate symbol names or obvious control flow.
- Remove stale or contradictory comments rather than layering new text on top.
- Avoid referring to previous behaviour, migrations, legacy in comments.
- State what the code does now, not what it used to do.
- Retain `TODO:` comments if they are still relevant; remove them if they have been implemented.

### Inline Comments

- Keep inline comments sparse
- Reserve them for subtle logic that a future maintainer could misread.
- Focus on intent, invariants, side effects, and non-obvious constraints.

### Documentation Comments

- Add to all types and members, including private members
- For the benefit of someone browsing the code.
- To allow IDEs to surface documentation in their UIs.
- They should be compact but informative.
- They do not need to slavishly repeat every parameter or return type.
- Add a larger comment before each type definition giving its purpose and design.

## Path Portability

- Do not embed machine-specific absolute paths in committed code, documentation, or configuration.
- Prefer repository-relative paths for resources that live in the current repository.
